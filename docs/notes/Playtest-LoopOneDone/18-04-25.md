# bugs

## Moving a factory down (into a table) silently prevents it from producing stuff

**Impact:**

medium(? in terms of fun at least)

**Description:**
I've noticed that one factory stopped producing stuff and just collects stuff in its inventory. After moving the table it was placed on, it started producing again.  
I'm not sure if I moved the table accidentally before that and caused the issue - I likely did. So there's probably a bug in the "you cant move that thing here" feature, but also potential to fix this via UX: maybe show a warning sign or so when the inventory fills up AND there
is no freshly produced item on the output.

## Table tilts and can no longer be positioned

**Impact:**
Low

**Description:**
This happened only once and while I was switching between the game and the Browser (Vivaldi, so not a default setup here), so probably a bit hard to reproduce.

I have a video of this:

As you see in the table suddenly tilted and stuck to the controller after I picked it up.

I got excited, since I thought I could hack this bug to create tilted factories, but I couldn't find a way to get rid of it. Only deleting the table worked.

## Save Game Slot Timestamp shows confusing time/data

**Impact:**

Low

**Description:**
Mix of bug and UX issue:

When I'm in the game, in a loaded game, the respective save slot still shows the start time of the last session (I think?!).
One time, when the game crashed, it got even more confusing: it showed the start time of the session before the session that crashed. Even though the autosave successfully saved the crashed game session.

Also: The save game slots don't highlight the currently loaded game. I think it would be nice to have a visual indication of the loaded game.

Together, this makes it a bit confusing to know which save game I'm currently playing.

- **Game Version:** 0.9.4 (Tested 17.04.25 + 18.04.25)
- **Hardware:** Quest 3, primarily using controllers
- **Meta Username:** `idontlikephonecalls`

**Media:**
This was right after the game crashed. I've started the first session at 8:58 (from a save game). It crashed at around 11:58 and after restarting the game, its save slot still says 8:58:

## items fly away/ disappear when picking them up to fast

**Impact:**

Low

**Description:**
Sometimes, when I react quickly and catch an item while it's falling down, it sticks to my hand/controller for a second but then flies away/ disappears. I've just noticed that, so no not that many details on it, but it's probably easy to reproduce.

# tiny UX annoyances

## Summoning of the Menu places the panes directly in front of the player

I found the placement of the summoned panes a bit too close to my hands. When I'm quickly building stuff and summoning it, it places both panels directly in frond oy my hands - but that's usually the place I want to build stuff.  
To build, I then have to move both panels away first.

**Suggestion:**
Place them a bit further away, maybe at an angle too.
One thing that I've noticed thought, that is a bit of a question/maybe UX bug/feature request(?) :
**I am still confused about how the recording feature works.**

After a bit of a break from VR, I jumped right into v0.9.4 and I must say: it feels so polished and smooth already, that I just spent hours in the sandbox and just built while having a YouTube Video playing in the background :POGGIES~1:
Grabbing, Placing and even how the pipes are handled feels veery nice, well done!

## I am still confused about how the recording feature works.

Assumption: the idea is that I can record a part of the loop and the rest will always be filled with "do nothing," right?

What I find confusing is that the actual recording stops at pressing the record button, but the UI still behaves like it is recording (playing the sound + lighting red).
It always feels weird to just leave it "record" and moving on building other stuff.
What plays into it: Personally, I would rather have the full loop to stop when I press the record button. To, for example, have a quick movement repeating without a delay (except when I left one in the
recording). [I now that that's like a core idea of the game so no need to change it, but I just wanted to mention it]

Suggestion:

Maybe add a short "recording done" tone when pressing the button again and then stop the UI behavior. The loop that fills up during the recoding shows me that there will be a "do nothing" section anyway (:

# feature requests

## Add decorating items

Would be nice to have some items that are not functional but just for decoration. Like the "Loop One Done" Logos that were in an earlier version (and are gone now, I think).  
Just a bit of random stuff. Maybe something moving/turning.

Why:
I found that having conveyor belts at random placed makes the playspace look more alive.
Also, when I recorded a short clip for a friend, the only way to show the game name was to have the Quest Menu open.

## When using the moving feature, the items that will be moved should be highlighted

As the title says, items should get highlighted when using the moving feature. To "select" the item to move.

Why:

Since I often build rather chaotic and dense, I often break parts of my factory when moving stuff :(

## Menu: Highlight selected game options

The game options in the menu should be highlighted when selected.

Why:
Just a super tiny thing that confused me a few times ;D

## Add an exit button to the menu

The autosave feature seems to work well, exiting via the Quest menu always leaves me with a bit of an unsure feeling of my precious factory being saved :D

## Allow the panels to be pinned to a location

Maybe add a small pin icon to the panels that allows to pin the panels to a location to prevent them from moving when summoned.

Why: When I'm building and summon the building panel, I don't really need the other panel. I'd pin it above the
