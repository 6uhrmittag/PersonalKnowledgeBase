## 15.02.25 - 4. session - Sandbox (v0.8.2)

(skipped session 3 bc. nothing interesting happened)

### 🔍 Session Overview

- **Duration:** 1h
- **Room Setup:** loving room; on the carpet
- **General Feeling of/after the Session:** having ca. 3h playtime now, this felt like the first "I just chill and play" session. No new glitches/quirks appeard, so just a comfy chill session(:

### ⭐ Cool Things I Noticed

1. This is the perfect game to keep the headset on for hours while doing stuff around the apartment.

### 🙁 Frustrations / UX Issues (subjective!)

1. Recording: I'm still not sure whow the timer of the recording works. When I start and stop it, the metronome stops, but the recording button stays in recording mode till the end of the 14s. It probably records for the full 14s for timing reasons - the UX of it is just a bit
