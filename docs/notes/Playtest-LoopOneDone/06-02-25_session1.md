# 06.02.25 - 1. Session - Living Area

Note: I did record the full 25 minutes of the first session. I'll have to re-watch it and check if there is anything interesting in there.

## 🔍 Session Overview

- **Duration:** 25 Minutes
- **Room Setup:** Living Area, standing
- **General Feeling of/after the Session:** A bit confused because it felt like it took me way too long to follow the intro, but confident that I now know the basics for the next session

## ⭐ Cool Things I Noticed

1. The possibility to look inside the Elevators etc. to see what's inside them is really cool! Got caught up in that for a few minutes

## 🐛 Potential Bugs / Technical Issues

I don't remember that I encountered any real bugs.

## 🙁 Frustrations / UX Issues (subjective!)

### Intro

1. The Intro isn't clear about whether I should use controllers or hand-tracking. It assumes I use hands, I think, but also mentions buttons. (I've noticed that there is a bugreport about that already.)
2. I was super overwhelmed by the amount of information/different inputs during the first minutes. The voice, Text, the game objects in the room. I think showing me a short video as intro would have helped me to get the big picture and also to "arrive in the game"
3. The voice-over is cool, but at one point she says something like "wait.. aha.. sorry about that I'm back again" which got me a bit confused if that got triggered somehow or is part of the intro. (but thats me I guess)

### Gameplay

1. I did not understand where I'm able to place stuff at first. Iron Elevators dropped to the ground after building and caused me to lose money a few times. (but I then knew it for the next session)
2. The sound of destroying objects felt a bit too loud compared to the environment.

## 💡 Suggestions & Improvements

1. saving feature: there should be a note that the game is autosaving.
