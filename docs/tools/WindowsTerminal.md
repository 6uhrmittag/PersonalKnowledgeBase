# Windows Terminal

## Notes

### Don't mix non-admin and admin Tabs (even though it's possible)!

!> If needed, open a new Terminal instance as Admin. Not a single Tab.

Even though it's possible to open a new tab as Admin, it somehow can break the security model. See details: https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/main/doc/Niksa.md#why-cant-we-have-mixed-elevated-and-non-elevated-tabs-in-the-terminal
