# Random VR and PC Addons, Accessories, and PC Hardware

Mainly for Quest and VRChat. But support depends on the addon.

## VR Addons

### Community/DIY Eye Tracking

- EyetrackerVR (ca. 100â‚¬)
    - PCB can be purchased from their store. It still requires ordering of other components off Aliexpress.

### Community/DIY Mouth Tracking

- Project Babble  (ca. 100â‚¬)
    - They maintain the Open Source Tool/Framework for mouth tracking, have their own hardware and license out to other community projects.
    - hardware is bigger than other solutions, but is always in stock to order.

- ventiFBT mouth tracking (ca. 80â‚¬)
    - A smaller and cheaper alternative to Project Babble, technically the same, I think.
    - not always in stock, check their discord for updates.
